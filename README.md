# Finding Frequent Itemsets - SON Algorithm

In this assignment, you will implement SON Algorithm using the Apache Spark Framework. You will develop a program to find frequent itemsets in two datasets, one simulated dataset and one real-world dataset generated from Yelp dataset. The goal of this assignment is to apply the algorithms you have learned in class on large datasets more efficiently in a distributed environment.
